Project Description

The project is a simple, smart system for predicting early fainting or falling using a wearable device (a small bracelet/unit) equipped with biometric sensors such as a pulse sensor and a blood oxygen sensor (SpO2 sensor).
The device continuously collects the user's biometric data, and whenever a sudden drop or abnormal change in these indicators is detected, the system predicts the possibility of fainting or falling.

Once this occurs, the system activates an alert mechanism through several channels:

Alerts the user directly via a sound or vibration on the device.

Sends an SMS message to relatives or other people close to them to inform them of their condition.

Notification via a simple mobile/web app that displays the user's status and previous alerts.

🎯 Project Objectives

Reducing the risks of fainting and falling through early prediction.

Providing a dual alert system (for the user himself and his family or surroundings).

A simplified prototype design that is scalable for future development.

Highlighting the potential of using simple sensors and basic programming techniques to develop smart healthcare solutions.

🔎 Project Scope (Scope)

Includes:

Data collection from biosensors (pulse + oxygen).

Simplified initial data processing (thresholds or rules).

Design of a prototype bracelet/hardware module.

Sending SMS alerts and app notifications.

Design of a simple application interface to display alerts.

Does not include:

Accurate medical analysis or health diagnosis.

Complex artificial intelligence algorithms (possibly referred to as Future Work).

Integration with formal medical systems or health databases.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies

Hardware: Pulse sensor, SpO2, controller (Arduino / ESP32), GSM module for SMS transmission.

Software: Arduino IDE, Python (for simple analysis if needed), API (Flutter/React or even a simple web page).

Note: SMS + app notifications.

✅ Simplicity Feature

The project will not delve into artificial intelligence.

It relies on sensors + simple Threshold prediction rules.

Students will develop it as a research-based project with a small prototype that demonstrates the concept.
